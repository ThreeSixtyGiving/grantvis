                <p>
                    GrantVis is a free tool to help you understand funders better.
                    You can combine and visualise 360Giving and charity data, and
                    explore funding across seven different areas – from grant dates
                    to types of recipients.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    GrantVis uses the <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/data/360giving-datastore/">360Giving
                        Datastore</a> to retrieve grants data
                    published by grantmakers to the 360Giving Data Standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each of the files has been published by a grantmaker, usually on their own website,
                    under a licence that allows the data to be reused and shared.
                    They have used a common format – the
                    <a href="http://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">360Giving
                        Data Standard</a>
                    – to make files in a consistent way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data shown on GrantVis has been fetched from the publisher's website by the 360Giving Datastore.
                    The Datastore checks
                    that it fits the Data Standard and adds some additional data about the geography and organisations
                    included, if possible.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    When will I see my data?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you've published data in the 360Giving Data Standard, your data should be available on
                    GrantVis
                    the day after it is shown on the <a href="http://data.threesixtygiving.org/">360Giving Registry</a>.
